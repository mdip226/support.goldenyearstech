My name is Matthew McCrea Dippel. I was born and raised in Lothian, MD. I graduated from University of North Carolina Asheville summa cum laude in 2022 with a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Systems. There, I worked on <a href="https://github.com/StochSS/stochss-compute">this</a> and I am a co-author along with other students and my professors, Dr. Drawert and Dr. Sanft, on <a href="https://lettersinbiomath.org/manuscript/index.php/lib/article/view/162/149">this</a> paper. In 2023, I released <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wahrheit&hl=en_US">this</a> android app on the Google Play Store. I enjoy music, die deutsche Sprache, the outdoors, meditation, learning, teaching, and helping.
